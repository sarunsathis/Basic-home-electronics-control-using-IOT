The author does not take responsiblity for any loss or damage of any of the components used. These codes are wriiten only for fun activity and not intended for regular uasges. The users are requested to flow the normal norms and safety measure before testing this model in dangerous situations. This project is still in the development stage and cannot yet replace the existing models in market. Users are free to make changes to code or even suggest codes. This projects has been tested on TinkerCAD. BE SAFE AND HAVE FUN.

# COMPONENTS USED :
ESP8266 nodeMCU, relays (according to connection type), temperature sesors.

# CONNECTIONS :
Please refer the attached tinkercad screenshot or reference.

# DESCRIPTION :
The main aim of this project is to connect high voltage elements in the house to internet. It provides access to all those devices on the same network and can be used to control the lights. Since the system provides a feedback on the status of each component used, user can optimize it to reduce power consumptions. future plan of this project is to provide a secure login to individual address so that it can be accessed from any part of the world. This can help in significant reduction on electricity bills and to a greener world.
